# Legacy README (Archived)

This file represents the previous, very detailed `README.md` that documented:

- All historical ingestion flows (domain knowledge, support knowledge)
- Legacy hybrid search prompts and Langflow wiring
- Older OpenSearch index mappings and troubleshooting notes

It has been archived here to keep the project root focused on the current UI, architecture, and enterprise-search value story.  
For the full original content, use your git history to inspect `README.md` before the archive refactor.
