# INGEST_EXPANDED_PRODUCTS.md (Archived)

This markdown described how to ingest an expanded Lexora product catalog into OpenSearch.  
It has been archived as `docs/archive/INGEST_EXPANDED_PRODUCTS.md` to keep the root cleaner.

Refer to the current `README.md` for a high‑level view of indices and ingestion, and consult git history if you need the original step‑by‑step commands.
