# README_FRONTEND.md (Archived)

This was the original frontend setup guide for the Next.js application.  
It has been archived here to reduce noise in the project root.

Use the new root `README.md` for the current quick‑start and architecture overview.  
For the exact previous content, check git history for `README_FRONTEND.md`.
